# 2D Game Engine

**Experimental 2D game engine built from scratch in C++ using the Win32 API**

---

## 📌 Description

This project is a work-in-progress 2D game engine written in C++, inspired by the **Handmade Hero** series by Casey Muratori.  
The engine is developed from the ground up with a focus on **low-level systems programming**, **performance optimization**, and **direct control over hardware resources**.  

The current implementation establishes the foundation for real-time rendering, input, audio, and timing — providing the essential building blocks for a performant custom game engine.

---

## 🖥️ Native Systems Programming

The engine interfaces directly with the **Win32 API** to handle window creation, graphics output, audio playback, timing, and input events.  
By avoiding external frameworks and high-level libraries, the project provides complete control of performance-critical components and system-level behavior.

## ✨ Implemented Features

- 🖼️ **Frame rendering and blitting** system for drawing graphics directly to the screen  
- 🎵 **DirectSound audio output** for low-latency sound playback  
- 🎮 **Input handling** for real-time keyboard and controller interactions  
- 💾 **Custom memory management** to allocate and track resources efficiently  
- ⏱️ **High-precision timing** using `QueryPerformanceCounter` and `RDTSC` for profiling and frame scheduling

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is actively being expanded to include advanced rendering, asset pipelines, and game loop features.

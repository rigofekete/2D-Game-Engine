# 2D Game Engine

**Experimental 2D game engine built from scratch in C using the Win32 API**

---

## Description

This project is a work-in-progress 2D game engine written in C and compliled in C++ with MSVC, inspired by the **Handmade Hero** series by Casey Muratori.  
The engine is developed from the ground up with a focus on **low-level systems programming**, **performance optimization**, and **direct control over hardware resources**.  

The current implementation establishes the foundation for real-time rendering, input, audio, and timing — providing the essential building blocks for a performant custom game engine.

---

## Native Systems Programming

The engine interfaces directly with the **Win32 API** to handle window creation, graphics output, audio playback, timing, and input events.  
By avoiding external frameworks and high-level libraries, the project provides complete control of performance-critical components and system-level behavior.  

---

## Implemented Features

- **Frame rendering and blitting** system for drawing graphics directly to the screen  
- **DirectSound audio output** for low-latency sound playback  
- **Input handling** for real-time keyboard and controller interactions  
- **Custom memory management** to allocate and track resources efficiently  
- **High-precision timing** using `QueryPerformanceCounter` and `RDTSC` for profiling and frame scheduling

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This project is actively being expanded to include advanced rendering, asset pipelines, and game loop features.
